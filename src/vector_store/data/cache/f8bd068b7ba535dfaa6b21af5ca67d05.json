    "abstract": "Deep learning algorithms, in particular convolutional networks, have rapidly become a methodology of choice for analyzing medical images. This paper reviews the major deep learning concepts pertinent to medical image analysis and summarizes over 300 contributions to the field, most of which appeared in the last year. We survey the use of deep learning for image classification, object detection, segmentation, registration, and other tasks. Concise overviews are provided of studies per application area: neuro, retinal, pulmonary, digital pathology, breast, cardiac, abdominal, musculoskeletal. We end with a summary of the current state-of-the-art, a critical discussion of open challenges and directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "With an increase in deep learning-based methods, the call for explainability of such methods grows, especially in high-stakes decision making areas such as medical image analysis. This survey presents an overview of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) used in deep learning-based medical image analysis. A framework of XAI criteria is introduced to classify deep learning-based medical image analysis methods. Papers on XAI techniques in medical image analysis are then surveyed and categorized according to the framework and according to anatomical location. The paper concludes with an outlook of future opportunities for XAI in medical image analysis.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has received extensive research interest in developing new medical image processing algorithms, and deep learning based models have been remarkably successful in a variety of medical imaging tasks to support disease detection and diagnosis. Despite the success, the further improvement of deep learning models in medical image analysis is majorly bottlenecked by the lack of large-sized and well-annotated datasets. In the past five years, many studies have focused on addressing this challenge. In this paper, we reviewed and summarized these recent studies to provide a comprehensive overview of applying deep learning methods in various medical image analysis tasks. Especially, we emphasize the latest progress and contributions of state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised deep learning in medical image analysis, which are summarized based on different application scenarios, including classification, segmentation, detection, and image registration. We also discuss major technical challenges and suggest possible solutions in the future research efforts.",
