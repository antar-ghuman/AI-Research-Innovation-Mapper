    "abstract": "The methylation profile of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is of great interest as a liquid biopsy for the detection and monitoring of cancer and other pathologies. Here we introduce  circulating cell-free DNA reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (cf-RRBS), enabling the use of highly effective RRBS on highly fragmented plasma cfDNA as well as on FFPE-archived cancer tissues. The method enriches the CpG-rich RRBS target regions by enzymatic degradation of all off-target DNA rather than by targeted capture, in contrast to previous methods. Critical steps are fully enzymatic in a single-tube, making it rapid, cost-effective, robust and easily implemented on a liquid-handling station for high-throughput sample preparation. We benchmark cf-RRBS results to those obtained by previous more complex methods and exemplify its use for accurate non-invasive subtyping of lung cancer, a frequent onco-pathology task. cf-RRBS enables any molecular pathology lab to tap into the cfDNA methylome, only making use of off-the-shelf reagents and open-source data analysis tools.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryNovel methodology enables facile and cost-effective methylation profiling of fragmented plasma DNA, allowing for routine liquid biopsy clinical diagnostics, exemplified here for differential diagnosis of lung cancer subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Neural activity encoding recent experiences is replayed during sleep and rest to promote consolidation of memories. However, precisely which features of experience influence replay prioritisation to optimise adaptive behaviour remains unclear. Here, we trained adult male rats on a novel maze-based reinforcement learning task designed to dissociate reward outcomes from reward-prediction errors. Four variations of a reinforcement learning model were fitted to the rats' behaviour over multiple days. Behaviour was best predicted by a model incorporating replay biased by reward-prediction error, compared to the same model with no replay, random replay or reward-biased replay. Neural population recordings from the hippocampus and ventral striatum of rats trained in the task evidenced preferential reactivation of reward-prediction and reward-prediction error signals during post-task rest. These insights disentangle the influences of salience on replay, suggesting that reinforcement learning is tuned by post-learning replay biased by reward-prediction error, not by reward per se. This work therefore provides a behavioural and theoretical toolkit with which to measure and interpret the neural mechanisms linking replay and reinforcement learning.",

    "abstract": "Sp8 and Sp6 are two closely related Sp genes expressed in the limb ectoderm, where they regulate proximo-distal and dorso-ventral patterning. Genetic studies in mice have shown that they act in a dose-dependent manner, with Sp8 exerting a substantially stronger effect than Sp6. Here, we integrate ChIPmentation-seq and RNA-seq analyses to elucidate their genome-wide regulatory networks and mechanisms of action. Our results show that Sp8 has a dual mode of action either directly binding GC-rich motifs or indirectly binding AT-rich motifs through Dlx. In contrast, Sp6 primarily acts through AT-rich motifs, via interaction with cofactors such as Dlx5. Both factors regulate key components of the Wnt, FGF, and BMP signaling pathways, central to limb patterning, and display both cooperative and independent roles. We further show that Sp8 and Sp6 can form homo- and heterodimers, as well as interact with Dlx5, revealing a complex regulatory network. Our findings provide molecular insight into limb morphogenesis and have potential implications for understanding congenital limb malformations.",
