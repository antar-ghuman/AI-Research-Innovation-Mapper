    "abstract": "Skin cancer is one of the most dangerous forms of cancer. Skin cancer is caused by un-repaired deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in skin cells, which generate genetic defects or mutations on the skin. Skin cancer tends to gradually spread over other body parts, so it is more curable in initial stages, which is why it is best detected at early stages. The increasing rate of skin cancer cases, high mortality rate, and expensive medical treatment require that its symptoms be diagnosed early. Considering the seriousness of these issues, researchers have developed various early detection techniques for skin cancer. Lesion parameters such as symmetry, color, size, shape, etc. are used to detect skin cancer and to distinguish benign skin cancer from melanoma. This paper presents a detailed systematic review of deep learning techniques for the early detection of skin cancer. Research papers published in well-reputed journals, relevant to the topic of skin cancer diagnosis, were analyzed. Research findings are presented in tools, graphs, tables, techniques, and frameworks for better understanding.",

    "abstract": "Breast Cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and second leading cause of mortality among women. About 1 in 8 US women (about 13%) will develop invasive BC throughout their lifetime. Early detection of this life-threatening disease not only increases the survival rate but also reduces the treatment cost. Fortunately, advancements in radiographic imaging like \"Mammograms\", \"Computed Tomography (CT)\", \"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\", \"3D Mammography\", and \"Histopathological Imaging (HI)\" have made it feasible to diagnose this life-taking disease at an early stage. However, the analysis of radiographic images and Histopathological images is done by experienced radiologists and pathologists, respectively. The process is not only costly but also error-prone. Over the last ten years, Computer Vision and Machine Learning (ML) have transformed the world in every way possible. Deep learning (DL), a subfield of ML has shown outstanding results in a variety of fields, particularly in the biomedical industry, because of its ability to handle large amounts of data. DL techniques automatically extract the features by analyzing the high dimensional and correlated data efficiently. The potential and ability of DL models have also been utilized and evaluated in the identification and prognosis of BC, utilizing radiographic and Histopathological images, and have performed admirably. However, AI has shown good claims in retrospective studies only. External validations are needed for translating these cutting-edge AI tools as a clinical decision maker. The main aim of this research work is to present the critical analysis of the research and findings already done to detect and classify BC using various imaging modalities including \"Mammography\", \"Histopathology\", \"Ultrasound\", \"PET/CT\", \"MRI\", and \"Thermography\". At first, a detailed review of the past research papers using Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning for BC classification and detection is carried out. We also review the publicly available datasets for the above-mentioned imaging modalities to make future research more accessible. Finally, a critical discussion section has been included to elaborate open research difficulties and prospects for future study in this emerging area, demonstrating the limitations of Deep Learning approaches.",

Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women, and many applications have been developed to improve its early detection. The purpose of this review is to examine how various deep learning methods can be applied to breast cancer screening workflows. We summarize deep learning methods, data availability and different screening methods for breast cancer including mammography, thermography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. In this review, we will explore deep learning in diagnostic breast imaging and describe the literature review. As a conclusion, we discuss some of the limitations and opportunities of integrating artificial intelligence into breast cancer clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "This review gives an overview of the current state of deep learning research in breast cancer imaging. Breast imaging plays a major role in detecting breast cancer at an earlier stage, as well as monitoring and evaluating breast cancer during treatment. The most commonly used modalities for breast imaging are digital mammography, digital breast tomosynthesis, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Nuclear medicine imaging techniques are used for detection and classification of axillary lymph nodes and distant staging in breast cancer imaging. All of these techniques are currently digitized, enabling the possibility to implement deep learning (DL), a subset of Artificial intelligence, in breast imaging. DL is nowadays embedded in a plethora of different tasks, such as lesion classification and segmentation, image reconstruction and generation, cancer risk prediction, and prediction and assessment of therapy response. Studies show similar and even better performances of DL algorithms compared to radiologists, although it is clear that large trials are needed, especially for ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, to exactly determine the added value of DL in breast cancer imaging. Studies on DL in nuclear medicine techniques are only sparsely available and further research is mandatory. Legal and ethical issues need to be considered before the role of DL can expand to its full potential in clinical breast care practice.",

    "abstract": "T cells recognize tumor antigens and initiate an anticancer immune response in the very early stages of tumor development, and the antigen specificity of T cells is determined by the T-cell receptor (TCR). Therefore, monitoring changes in the TCR repertoire in peripheral blood may offer a strategy to detect various cancers at a relatively early stage. Here, we developed the deep learning framework iCanTCR to identify patients with cancer based on the TCR repertoire. The iCanTCR framework uses TCRÎ² sequences from an individual as an input and outputs the predicted cancer probability. The model was trained on over 2,000 publicly available TCR repertoires from 11 types of cancer and healthy controls. Analysis of several additional publicly available datasets validated the ability of iCanTCR to distinguish patients with cancer from noncancer individuals and demonstrated the capability of iCanTCR for the accurate classification of multiple cancers. Importantly, iCanTCR precisely identified individuals with early-stage cancer with an AUC of 86%. Altogether, this work provides a liquid biopsy approach to capture immune signals from peripheral blood for noninvasive cancer diagnosis.",
